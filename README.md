# Angular Classes Archive

A compilation of all projects developed during my Angular classes at SÃ£o Paulo State Technological College in Santos. The projects cover subjects like basic math operations, conditional rules, routes, forms, usage of API's and authentication.

Work in progress.

## List of Projects
1. **Conditional Greeting:** a page that displays a greeting accordingly with the time of the day.

3. **Multiplication Table:** using a base number from input, shows in real time a table of that number multiplied from 1 to 10.
